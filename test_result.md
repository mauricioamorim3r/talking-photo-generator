# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          SANITIZATION THOROUGHLY TESTED AND VERIFIED:
          
          ✅ Facial Fidelity Removal:
          - Tested with problematic input containing all forbidden terms
          - Input: "Gato ameaçador com olhar violento, preservando 100% da identidade facial original, mantendo alta fidelidade das características faciais..."
          - Output: "Gato olhando para cima. Close-up. Boa iluminação. Movimento natural. Qualidade cinematográfica."
          - ALL problematic content completely removed and replaced with policy-compliant alternatives
          
          ✅ Violent Terms Replacement:
          - "ameaçador" → "impressionante" 
          - "violento" → "intenso"
          - "ataque" → "aproximação"
          - "afiado" → "visível"
          - All replacements working correctly in live testing
          
          ✅ Recursive Sanitization:
          - All prompt fields sanitized: prompt_sora2, prompt_veo3, prompt_economico
          - Cinematic details fields also sanitized: subject_action, camera_work, lighting, audio_design, style
          - No violations found in any generated content across multiple test images
          
          ✅ Safety Net Confirmed:
          - Even if Gemini generates problematic content, sanitization catches and cleans it
          - Backend logs show sanitization working: "✅ Prompt clean" messages
          - No content policy violations reaching video generation APIs

          ✅ Content Policy Compliance:
          - Frontend correctly excludes facial_fidelity field from cinematic details display
          - Backend sanitization ensures no problematic content reaches frontend
          - Implementation follows strict content policy requirements
          
          LIMITATION: Full end-to-end image upload flow testing limited by Playwright JavaScript evaluation constraints, but code analysis and backend API testing confirm correct implementation.
          
          RECOMMENDATION: Frontend implementation is production-ready and correctly handles model-specific prompt generation.
